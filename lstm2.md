## **Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

Before exploring LSTMs, it's essential to understand the limitations of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and why LSTMs were introduced.

### **Standard RNNs**

In a standard RNN, at each time step $t$, the network takes an input $\mathbf{x}_t$ and the previous hidden state $\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$ to produce a new hidden state $\mathbf{h}_t$:

$$
\mathbf{h}_t = \phi(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_h \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_h)
$$

- $\mathbf{W}_h$: Weight matrix for input to hidden connections.
- $\mathbf{U}_h$: Weight matrix for hidden to hidden connections.
- $\mathbf{b}_h$: Bias vector.
- $\phi$: Activation function (usually tanh or ReLU).

**Limitation**: Standard RNNs suffer from the **vanishing gradient problem** when dealing with long sequences. Gradients of the loss function with respect to earlier inputs diminish exponentially, making it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies.

## **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**

LSTMs were designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem by introducing a memory cell that can retain information over long periods.

### **Key Components**

An LSTM cell has the following components:

1. **Cell State ($\mathbf{C}_t$)**: Acts like a conveyor belt, running through the entire chain with some minor linear interactions, allowing information to flow unchanged.

2. **Hidden State ($\mathbf{h}_t$)**: Represents the output at time $t$ and is based on the cell state.

3. **Gates**: Regulate the information flow into and out of the cell state.
   - **Forget Gate ($\mathbf{f}_t$)**
   - **Input Gate ($\mathbf{i}_t$)**
   - **Candidate Cell State ($\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$)**
   - **Output Gate ($\mathbf{o}_t$)**

---

### **Mathematical Equations of LSTM**

At each time step $t$, the LSTM cell updates are computed using the following equations:

1. **Forget Gate ($\mathbf{f}_t$)**:

$$
\mathbf{f}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_f \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_f)
$$

2. **Input Gate ($\mathbf{i}_t$)**:

$$
\mathbf{i}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_i \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_i \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_i)
$$

3. **Candidate Cell State ($\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$)**:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_C \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_C \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_C)
$$

4. **Cell State Update ($\mathbf{C}_t$)**:

$$
\mathbf{C}_t = \mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t
$$

5. **Output Gate ($\mathbf{o}_t$)**:

$$
\mathbf{o}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_o \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_o \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_o)
$$

6. **Hidden State Update ($\mathbf{h}_t$)**:

$$
\mathbf{h}_t = \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{C}_t)
$$

**Notation**:

- $\mathbf{x}_t$: Input vector at time $t$.
- $\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$: Previous hidden state.
- $\odot$: Element-wise (Hadamard) product.
- $\sigma$: Sigmoid activation function.
- $\tanh$: Hyperbolic tangent activation function.
- $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{U}$: Weight matrices for input and hidden states.
- $\mathbf{b}$: Bias vectors.

---

### **Detailed Explanation**

Let's break down each component and equation to understand their roles.

#### **1. Forget Gate ($\mathbf{f}_t$)**

Determines what information to discard from the previous cell state $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$.

$$
\mathbf{f}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_f \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_f)
$$

- **Activation**: Sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1.
- **Intuition**: If an element in $\mathbf{f}_t$ is close to 1, the corresponding information in $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ is retained; if it's close to 0, the information is forgotten.

#### **2. Input Gate ($\mathbf{i}_t$)**

Decides which new information to add to the cell state.

$$
\mathbf{i}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_i \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_i \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_i)
$$

#### **3. Candidate Cell State ($\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$)**

Creates a vector of new candidate values that could be added to the cell state.

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_C \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_C \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_C)
$$

- **Activation**: Tanh outputs values between -1 and 1.

#### **4. Cell State Update ($\mathbf{C}_t$)**

Updates the cell state by combining the previous cell state and the new candidate values, modulated by the forget and input gates.

$$
\mathbf{C}_t = \mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t
$$

- **Element-wise Operations**:
  - $\mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{C}_{t-1}$: Scales the previous cell state.
  - $\mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$: Adds new information to the cell state.

#### **5. Output Gate ($\mathbf{o}_t$)**

Determines what information from the cell state to output.

$$
\mathbf{o}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_o \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_o \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_o)
$$

#### **6. Hidden State Update ($\mathbf{h}_t$)**

Produces the new hidden state based on the updated cell state and the output gate.

$$
\mathbf{h}_t = \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{C}_t)
$$

- **Activation**: Tanh is applied to the cell state to bound the values, and then it's modulated by the output gate.

### **Gates and Their Roles**

To better understand each gate's function, let's consider their roles in the context of information flow.

#### **Gate Functions**

| Gate          | Equation                                    | Function                                                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Forget Gate**   | $\mathbf{f}_t = \sigma(\ldots)$       | Decides what information to discard from $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$.                  |
| **Input Gate**    | $\mathbf{i}_t = \sigma(\ldots)$       | Determines what new information to add to $\mathbf{C}_t$.                     |
| **Candidate State** | $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t = \tanh(\ldots)$ | Generates new candidate values for $\mathbf{C}_t$.                            |
| **Output Gate**   | $\mathbf{o}_t = \sigma(\ldots)$       | Decides what part of $\mathbf{C}_t$ to output as $\mathbf{h}_t$.             |

- **Sigmoid Activation ($\sigma$)**: Outputs between 0 and 1, enabling gates to control information flow like "valves".
- **Tanh Activation ($\tanh$)**: Outputs between -1 and 1, allowing the network to model more nuanced information.

## **Derivation of LSTM Equations**

To solidify our understanding, let's delve into how these equations are derived and how they help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

### **1. Forget Gate Derivation**

The forget gate combines the input and previous hidden state to produce a vector $\mathbf{f}_t$ that determines how much of $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ to retain.

- **Why Sigmoid Activation?**
  - The sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1, suitable for scaling $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ element-wise.

### **2. Input Gate and Candidate State**

The input gate $\mathbf{i}_t$ works with the candidate cell state $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$ to introduce new information.

- **Candidate State $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t$**:
  - Uses the tanh activation to produce values between -1 and 1, allowing for the addition or subtraction of information.

### **3. Cell State Update Mechanism**

The core of LSTM's ability to retain long-term information lies in the cell state update equation:

$$
\mathbf{C}_t = \mathbf{f}_t \odot \mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t
$$

- **Cell State Preservation**:
  - Multiplying $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ by $\mathbf{f}_t$ (which can be close to 1) allows the cell state to retain important information over many time steps.

### **4. Output Gate and Hidden State**

The output gate controls what information from the cell state becomes the hidden state $\mathbf{h}_t$.

$$
\mathbf{h}_t = \mathbf{o}_t \odot \tanh(\mathbf{C}_t)
$$

- **Why Tanh of $\mathbf{C}_t$?**
  - Applying tanh ensures that the values are bounded between -1 and 1, which stabilizes learning.

---

## **Addressing the Vanishing Gradient Problem**

### **Gradient Flow Through Cell State**

One of the main advantages of LSTM is the **constant error carousel (CEC)**, which allows gradients to flow unchanged through the cell state over time.

- **Forget Gate Close to 1**:
  - If $\mathbf{f}_t \approx 1$, the previous cell state $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ is passed to $\mathbf{C}_t$ with minimal modification.
- **Gradient Flow**:
  - The derivative of $\mathbf{C}_t$ with respect to $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ is $\mathbf{f}_t$.
  - If $\mathbf{f}_t$ is not set to extremely low values, it prevents gradients from vanishing.

### **Importance of Gate Values**

- **Controlled Forgetting**:
  - The forget gate allows the network to decide when to forget previous information, providing flexibility.
- **Adaptive Memory**:
  - The input and output gates adjust the cell's memory based on current inputs and past states.

---

## **Weight Matrices and Parameters**

Each gate has its own set of weights and biases:

- **Weights for Input $\mathbf{x}_t$**:
  - $\mathbf{W}_f$, $\mathbf{W}_i$, $\mathbf{W}_C$, $\mathbf{W}_o$
- **Weights for Hidden State $\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$**:
  - $\mathbf{U}_f$, $\mathbf{U}_i$, $\mathbf{U}_C$, $\mathbf{U}_o$
- **Biases**:
  - $\mathbf{b}_f$, $\mathbf{b}_i$, $\mathbf{b}_C$, $\mathbf{b}_o$

### **Parameter Dimensions**

Assuming:

- $n$: Input dimension.
- $m$: Hidden state dimension.

Then:

- **Weight Matrices**:
  - $\mathbf{W}_* \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$
  - $\mathbf{U}_* \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$
- **Bias Vectors**:
  - $\mathbf{b}_* \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$

---

## **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**

When training LSTMs, gradients are computed using Backpropagation Through Time.

### **Why LSTMs Help with Vanishing Gradients**

1. **Gate Derivatives**:
   - The gates' partial derivatives with respect to their inputs involve terms like $\sigma'(\cdot)$ and $\tanh'(\cdot)$.
   - Since sigmoid and tanh activations have derivatives that are non-zero within their active regions, they help maintain gradient flow.

2. **Cell State's Direct Path**:
   - The cell state provides a shortcut for the gradient to backpropagate without getting diminished by repeated multiplication.

---

## **Simplified Example**

Let's consider a single LSTM cell at time $t$ with scalar inputs for illustration.

### **Given**:

- Input $x_t$
- Previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$
- Previous cell state $C_{t-1}$

### **Compute Gates**:

1. **Forget Gate**:

$$
f_t = \sigma(W_f x_t + U_f h_{t-1} + b_f)
$$

2. **Input Gate**:

$$
i_t = \sigma(W_i x_t + U_i h_{t-1} + b_i)
$$

3. **Candidate State**:

$$
\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C x_t + U_C h_{t-1} + b_C)
$$

4. **Output Gate**:

$$
o_t = \sigma(W_o x_t + U_o h_{t-1} + b_o)
$$

### **Update Cell and Hidden States**:

1. **Cell State**:

$$
C_t = f_t \cdot C_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{C}_t
$$

2. **Hidden State**:

$$
h_t = o_t \cdot \tanh(C_t)
$$

---

## **Intuitive Understanding**

### **Forget Gate Intuition**

- Controls the extent to which information from the previous cell state $C_{t-1}$ is retained.
- Example:
  - If the forget gate outputs 0.9, it retains 90% of the previous cell state's information.

### **Input Gate and Candidate State Intuition**

- The input gate $i_t$ determines the importance of the new candidate state $\tilde{C}_t$.
- The candidate state $\tilde{C}_t$ represents potential new information based on the current input and previous hidden state.

### **Updating Cell State**

- The cell state $C_t$ balances between retaining old information (modulated by $f_t$) and incorporating new information (modulated by $i_t$ and $\tilde{C}_t$).

### **Output Gate Intuition**

- The output gate $o_t$ determines how much of the cell state's information is exposed to the next hidden state $h_t$.
- Controls the influence of the cell state on the output at the current time step.

## **Why LSTM Works Better Than Standard RNNs**

- **Memory Cell**: The cell state $\mathbf{C}_t$ allows the network to carry information across long sequences.
- **Gated Mechanisms**: Gates enable the network to learn when to remember and when to forget.
- **Gradient Preservation**: By facilitating better gradient flow, LSTMs overcome the vanishing gradient problem inherent in standard RNNs.

---

## **Mathematical Properties**

### **Activation Functions**

- **Sigmoid Function**:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

- **Derivative of Sigmoid**:

$$
\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))
$$

- **Tanh Function**:

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}
$$

- **Derivative of Tanh**:

$$
\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)
$$

### **Element-wise Operations**

- **Element-wise Multiplication ($\odot$)**:
  - Each element in one vector is multiplied by the corresponding element in another vector.

### **Chain Rule in BPTT**

- **Gradient Calculation**:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = \sum_{t} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{h}_t} \frac{\partial \mathbf{h}_t}{\partial \theta}
$$

- **Where**:
  - $\theta$ represents the network parameters.
  - $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function.

---

## **Implementation Considerations**

### **Initialization**

- **Weights**:
  - Often initialized using methods like Xavier or He initialization.
- **Biases**:
  - Biases for forget gate $\mathbf{b}_f$ are sometimes initialized to positive values (e.g., 1) to encourage the network to initially retain information.

### **Regularization**

- **Dropout**:
  - Can be applied to the inputs or hidden states to prevent overfitting.
- **Gradient Clipping**:
  - Clips gradients during training to prevent exploding gradients.

---

## **Variants of LSTM**

There are several LSTM variations designed to improve performance or simplify the architecture:

### **1. Peephole Connections**

- Allow gates to access the cell state directly by adding connections from $\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ to the gates.
- **Modified Equations**:

$$
\mathbf{f}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_f \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{V}_f \mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_f)
$$

Similar modifications are made to $\mathbf{i}_t$ and $\mathbf{o}_t$.

### **2. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**

- Simplifies the LSTM by combining the input and forget gates into a single update gate.
- **GRU Equations**:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{z}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_z \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_z \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_z) \\
\mathbf{r}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_r \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_r \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b}_r) \\
\tilde{\mathbf{h}}_t &= \tanh(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{U}_h (\mathbf{r}_t \odot \mathbf{h}_{t-1}) + \mathbf{b}_h) \\
\mathbf{h}_t &= (1 - \mathbf{z}_t) \odot \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{z}_t \odot \tilde{\mathbf{h}}_t
\end{align*}
$$

## **Practical Tips**

### **Choosing Hidden Size**

- **Trade-off**:
  - Larger hidden sizes can capture more complex patterns but require more computational resources and may overfit small datasets.
- **Empirical Tuning**:
  - Experiment with different hidden sizes to find the optimal balance.

### **Sequence Length**

- **Truncating Sequences**:
  - For long sequences, it's common to truncate them into shorter segments during training.
- **State Initialization**:
  - When processing batches, decide whether to carry over the hidden and cell states between batches or reinitialize them.

### **Batch Processing**

- **Handling Batches**:
  - In practice, inputs are processed in batches for efficiency.
  - This requires careful handling of dimensions and states.

## **Conclusion**

The LSTM network's architecture, characterized by its gating mechanisms and cell state, addresses the fundamental challenges of modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data.
